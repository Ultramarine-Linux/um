description: "Install the Nix package manager"
type: toggle
stability: alpha

warning: |-
    This enables the Nix package manager by executing the Determinate Systems 
    Nix Installer silently. Stability is alpha as it does mess with your root
    btrfs (It creates a subvol with higher compression, thanks to Nix's large
    storage requirements). Nix allows for ephemeral shells as well as 
    reproducable development and execution environments without the need for 
    a container runtime or virtualization.
