description: "Uninstall Old kernels"
type: script
stability: stable

warning: |-
    This will remove all older kernel versions from your system, keeping only the currently running kernel and the latest installed kernel.
    You will lose the ability to fall back to an older kernel version if you encounter issues with the newest available kernel!
    Ensure that your latest kernel is functioning properly before proceeding.
    You can check your current kernel version with `uname -r` and the installed kernels with `rpm -q kernel`.
    
    This tweak may not work if you install a custom kernel with a different naming scheme than just "kernel".
