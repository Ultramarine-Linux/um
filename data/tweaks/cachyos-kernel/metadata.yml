description: "Install CachyOS Kernel"
type: toggle
stability: stable

warning: |-
    Using the CachyOS kernel may lead to some compatibility issues with CPUs older than
    x86-64-v3 (AVX2), increasing the minimum requirements to:
    - Intel: Haswell (4th Gen Core) or newer
    - AMD: Excavator (AMD Athlon X4 845 or newer) or Zen (Ryzen series)

    Additionally, this may also break Secure Boot functionality if you have not already set up
    `sbctl`. Please set up `sbctl` before enabling this tweak to avoid boot issues.
    
    `sbctl` is available in the Terra repository:
        sudo dnf install sbctl
    
    Please refer to the CachyOS COPR documentation for more details:
