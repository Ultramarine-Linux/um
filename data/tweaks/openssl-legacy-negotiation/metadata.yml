description: "Use unsafe legacy negotiation for OpenSSL."
type: toggle
stability: stable

warning: |-
    This makes OpenSSL use a legacy negotiation method that is considered unsafe and deprecated as of RFC 5746.
    Only enable this if you require compatibility with networks that do not support secure renegotiation, such as some legacy MSCHAPv2 setups.
    Enabling this may expose your system to security vulnerabilities,
    See https://docs.openssl.org/1.0.2/man3/SSL_CTX_set_options/#patched-openssl-client-and-unpatched-server for more information.
