description: "OpenSSL: Use Unsafe Legacy Negotiation (eduroam compatibility fix)"
type: toggle
stability: 4

warning: |-
    This makes OpenSSL use a legacy negotiation method that is considered unsafe and deprecated as of RFC 5746.
    Only enable this if you require compatibility with networks that do not support secure renegotiation, such as eduroam or custom MSCHAPv2 setups.
    Enabling this may expose your system to security vulnerabilities,
    See https://docs.openssl.org/1.0.2/man3/SSL_CTX_set_options/#patched-openssl-client-and-unpatched-server for more information.

    If your network covers eduroam, it is recommended you use eduroam CAT to configure your device instead of enabling this option.
    See https://cat.eduroam.org/ for more information.
